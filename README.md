# Introduction

This is a definition and reference implementation for MRA (Multidimensional Relational Algebra), the core calculus for [Quasar](http://github.com/quasar-analytics/quasar), an analytics engine for semi-structured data.

Quasar's support for SQL<sup>2</sup> is layered atop MRA, and many features of the SQL dialect have a natural and high-level mapping to MRA.

# Tests

Tests for the reference implementation (such as they are) are located in `src/Test.purs`.

# MRA Spec

TODO: A higher-level mathematical specification of the work contained herein which elides irrelevant details of this implementation.
